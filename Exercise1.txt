1. Repository Lifecycle
Task: Create a new Git repository from scratch using git init.

Validate: Create and track files, stage changes, commit them, and view log history.

Commands to use: init, add, commit, status, log

🌐 2. Remote Collaboration Simulation
Task: Clone a public repository, add a new file, commit it, and push it to your fork.

Validate: Practice syncing with the upstream repo using git pull and resolving any merge conflicts.

Commands to use: clone, push, pull, remote, fetch, merge

🌿 3. Feature Branching Workflow
Task: Create a new branch called feature/navbar, make changes, and merge back into main.

Stretch: Try both merge and rebase workflows.

Commands to use: branch, checkout, merge, rebase, log --oneline --graph

🎯 4. Conflict Resolution
Task: Intentionally create a merge conflict (e.g., edit same line in two branches), then resolve it.

Validate: Use a merge tool or manual resolution and complete the merge.

Commands to use: merge, status, diff, add, commit, optionally mergetool

📦 5. Stashing Work
Task: Modify a file without committing, stash the changes, switch branches, then reapply the stash.

Stretch: Use stash pop, stash list, and stash drop.

Commands to use: stash, stash list, stash pop, stash apply, stash drop

🔄 7. Undoing Mistakes
Task: Try the following and recover:

Revert a bad commit (git revert)

Reset to an older commit and recover using reflog

Commands to use: revert, reset, reflog, checkout, commit --amend

🔁 8. Rebasing for Clean History
Task: Create two feature branches, simulate development, then rebase one onto another.

Validate: Squash multiple commits into one before merging.

Commands to use: rebase, rebase -i, log, squash

🤝 9. Basic GitHub Workflow
Task: Fork a repo, make a PR (Pull Request), review another PR, and merge after review.

Stretch: Request changes and make updates in response to review.

Platform Tools: GitHub UI, gh CLI (optional)

🛡️ 10. Branching Strategy Simulation
Task: Apply a branching strategy (GitFlow or Trunk-based) in a small team.

Validate: Practice feature → dev → release → main flows and hotfixes.

Stretch: Define branch naming conventions and role of protected branches.

📘 Bonus: Challenge Exercises
Reproduce a deleted branch using reflog.

Create a Git alias to simplify a frequent command.

Setup a .gitignore file and explain why certain files should be excluded.

Visualize commit history as a graph (git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph).
